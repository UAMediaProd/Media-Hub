# Media Hub Web App

Built using the NEAT (Netlify CMS, Eleventy, Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS) Starter boilerplate.

Uses 11ty for static site generation and Netlify CMS for content management. 

## Aims

From this set up, we can use Netlify CMS as a GUI for creating series of media elements in a CMS-like interface.
